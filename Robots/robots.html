in human-robot collaboration, the robot assists the human
operator. This means: The machine does not replace the
human, but complementes his capabilities and relieves him of
arduous tasks. These can include overhead work, for
example, or the lifting of heavy loads. Autonomous,
collaborative robots are also used to supply production
workstations.

Hitiing the show floor at CES can
be something of a challenge. There

narrow my focus to just one area
-- robotics -- and it made my job
a lot easier. Or it should have

The number of robots in the world today is
approaching 1,000,000, with almost half that
number in japan and just 15% in the US. A
couple of decades ago, 90% of robots were
used in car manufacturing, typically on
assemblymlines doing a variety of repetitive
tasks. Today only 50% are in automobile
plants,with the other half spread out among
other factories, and many other industries.
